## Deploying Packer Images with Terraform

    * Once a Packer image has been created, it can be deployed using Terraform --
    * Terraform reads the Packer image's ID and uses it to launch instances in the cloud --
    * This allows you to automate the deployment of your infrastructure, ensuring consistency across multiple environments
