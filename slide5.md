## Benefits of Packer and Terraform Integration

-   Integrating Packer and Terraform offers numerous benefits
-   It enables teams to codify images in Terraform configuration files, rather than hard-coding them    
- Furthermore, by provisioning instances from known-good images built by Packer, you can ensure only approved configurations are deployed

???
Crafting customized images with known configurations and deploying complete infrastructures streamlines provisioning and management, enhancing efficiency and reliability in infrastructure operations.
