## Creating Machine Images with Packer

Here's an example of incremental text (hit left to progress):

- Packer allows you to define your infrastructure in code and then use this code to generate machine images
- These images can include an operating system, software, and other configurations tailored to your specific needs 
- Once generated, these images can be stored and distributed for use in various environments

Packer enables secure infrastructure definition in code

Swiftly generating tailored machine images encompassing operating systems, software, and specific configurations

These images are securely stored and distributed for deployment across diverse environments
